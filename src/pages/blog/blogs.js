      {
        detail: `The most obvious place to start when considering the application of NFTs is luxury goods. Why? Because luxury goods are often characterised by their collectability, which lends itself well to the notion of scarcity and exclusivity.

        Luxury jewellery is also a product traditionally associated with high price points, due to the high cost of materials and craftsmanship involved. Therefore, there is an opportunity for NFTs to be used as a tool for curating scarcity and exclusivity in this industry.
        
        But first, let’s go over what an NFT actually is.

        subTitle: "NFTs: An Overview",
        detail: `Non-fungible tokens are digital asset which is unique or one-of-a-kind. They can be used on the blockchain to represent any physical or digital item, such as collectables, real estate and artwork.

        So why should you care? NFTs may be the key to creating a digital version of your jewellery collection which could be stored safely on a blockchain and traded securely using smart contracts.
        
        The potential benefits of this technology include:

      {
        subTitle: "1. Immutability (protection from fraud)",
        detail: `All NFTs are uniquely serialized and can only be transferred once, making them an excellent anti-counterfeit solution. As soon as an item is sold, the certificate becomes invalid and cannot be reused again.`,
      },
      {
        subTitle: "2. Ownership (no middleman)",
        detail: `With NFTs, the buyer has full ownership of their purchase. There is no middleman to deal with or pay fees to - it's just you and your piece of jewellery! The seller holds the rights to their brand while retaining all profits made from sales. It also means that there are no credit card fees or other hidden costs involved in purchasing an item from them as there are no intermediaries involved. `,
      },
      {
        subTitle: "3. Divisibility (the ability to divide an item into pieces)",
        detail: `This is especially useful in the case of luxury goods such as diamonds and gold where many investors want to get rid of some but not all of their holdings. With NFTs, investors can keep their investment liquid without having to sell off an entire piece of jewellery.`,
      },
      {
        subTitle:
          "4. Liquidity (easily traded, no lock-ins, no storage fees or insurance needed)",
        detail: `This means that jewellers who accept NFTs as payment can immediately sell their holdings for fiat currency if they so wish. This is a big advantage over other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can only be exchanged for fiat currency through expensive and slow options like bank transfers, credit card purchases, etc. `,
